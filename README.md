# SQL Mega Project: HR Data Management System
## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
This SQL-based HRDMS project focuses on analyzing employee data to uncover actionable HR insights such as attrition trends, departmental staffing, compensation analysis, and performance tracking using structured SQL queries.
Defines and populates core HR tables (regions, countries, locations, jobs, departments, employees, dependents) and demonstrates advanced querying techniques.

## Key Deliverables
- **Schema Design**  
  â€“ CREATE TABLE scripts with PK/FK constraints and cascade rules  
- **Data Population**  
  â€“ INSERT scripts loading sample lookup and transactional data  
- **Query Library**  
  â€“ 100+ example queries:  
  - Basic SELECTs, JOINs (INNER, LEFT, FULL, CROSS, self-joins)  
  - Aggregations (GROUP BY, HAVING)  
  - Window functions (`DENSE_RANK`)  
  - Subqueries, EXISTS/NOT EXISTS, INTERSECT, UNION  
  - DDL/DML examples (ALTER, UPDATE, DELETE)

## Sample Queries
SELECT TOP 5 *  
FROM employees  
ORDER BY salary DESC;

## Insights
- Highest attrition observed in the Sales department.
- Younger employees (under 30) and those with fewer years at the company show higher turnover rates.
- Managers and Senior Engineers command the highest average salaries.
- Entry-level positions are concentrated in the Technical and HR departments.
- Over 60% of employees have less than 5 years of experience.
- Only a small percentage of employees have stayed for more than 10 years, which could indicate retention challenges.
